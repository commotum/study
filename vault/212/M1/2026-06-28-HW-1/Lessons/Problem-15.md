## Introduction

The problem gives a graph of angular position $\theta_z(t)$ and asks for the matching angular acceleration graph over the same time interval.

![Angular position graph for Problem 15](../Source/Images/problem-15-angular-position.png)

The recognition cue is the phrase **angular acceleration** paired with a graph of **angular position**. Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, the move is to read the concavity of the position graph:

$$
\text{concave up} \Longrightarrow \alpha_z(t)>0
$$

$$
\text{concave down} \Longrightarrow \alpha_z(t)<0.
$$

Equivalently, watch the slope of $\theta_z(t)$:

- if the slope is increasing, $\alpha_z(t)>0$
- if the slope is decreasing, $\alpha_z(t)<0$
- if the concavity changes, $\alpha_z(t)$ crosses $0$

## Reading Curvature As Acceleration

**Example:** On an interval, $\theta_z(t)$ is decreasing, but the graph bends upward as it approaches a low point. Is $\alpha_z(t)$ positive or negative on that interval?

**Explanation**

The graph is decreasing, so the slope of $\theta_z(t)$ is negative. But the slope is becoming less negative as the graph bends toward a low point.

That means the slope is increasing:

$$
\text{more negative slope} \to \text{less negative slope} \to 0.
$$

An increasing slope means

$$
\alpha_z(t)>0.
$$

The sign of acceleration comes from how the slope changes, not from whether the position graph is rising or falling.

## Using Turning Points As Sign Checks

**Example:** A smooth graph of $\theta_z(t)$ has a local minimum at $t=1$. What sign should $\alpha_z(t)$ have near that low point?

**Explanation**

At a local minimum, the slope of $\theta_z(t)$ changes from negative to zero to positive.

That is an increase in slope:

$$
- \to 0 \to +.
$$

So near a smooth local minimum, the position graph is concave up and

$$
\alpha_z(t)>0.
$$

At a smooth local maximum, the slope changes from positive to zero to negative, so the slope is decreasing and $\alpha_z(t)<0$.

## Finding Inflection Points

**Example:** A graph of $\theta_z(t)$ changes from concave up to concave down at $t=1.5$. What happens to $\alpha_z(t)$ at that time?

**Explanation**

Angular acceleration is the second derivative:

$$
\alpha_z(t)=\frac{d^2\theta_z}{dt^2}.
$$

The second derivative is positive where $\theta_z(t)$ is concave up and negative where $\theta_z(t)$ is concave down. When the concavity changes from up to down, the acceleration changes sign from positive to negative.

So the acceleration graph should cross the zero line near $t=1.5$.

    Cross from negative to positive.
  correct: true

    Cross from positive to negative.

    Stay positive because angular position is increasing.

## Choosing The Matching Graph

**Example:** For the homework graph, decide which acceleration option matches the angular position graph.

**Explanation**

Use the main landmarks of the position graph:

- near the first low point, the position graph is concave up, so $\alpha_z(t)$ should be positive
- near the high point around the middle, the position graph is concave down, so $\alpha_z(t)$ should be negative
- near the next low point, the position graph is concave up again, so $\alpha_z(t)$ should be positive
- after the graph rises steeply near the end, it begins bending downward, so $\alpha_z(t)$ should become negative

The matching acceleration graph must alternate signs with the concavity pattern of the position graph. It is not enough for the graph to be above or below zero at the same times as $\theta_z(t)$.

A useful scan is:

| Feature in $\theta_z(t)$ | What it says about $\alpha_z(t)$ |
| --- | --- |
| first low point | $\alpha_z(t)>0$ nearby |
| middle high point | $\alpha_z(t)<0$ nearby |
| second low point | $\alpha_z(t)>0$ nearby |
| final bend downward | $\alpha_z(t)<0$ near the end |

Option A matches this sign pattern. The other options either stay mostly positive, oscillate too often, or put the positive and negative regions in the wrong places.

## Avoiding Slope And Height Traps

**Example:** Suppose $\theta_z(t)$ is positive and increasing, but its slope is getting smaller. What is the sign of $\alpha_z(t)$?

**Explanation**

The positive height of the graph only tells us $\theta_z(t)>0$.

The upward motion only tells us $\omega_z(t)>0$.

Acceleration depends on whether $\omega_z(t)$ is increasing or decreasing. If the slope of $\theta_z(t)$ is getting smaller, then $\omega_z(t)$ is decreasing, so

$$
\alpha_z(t)<0.
$$

For a graph-matching problem, test each option against curvature:

1. local minima in $\theta_z(t)$ should line up with positive $\alpha_z(t)$
2. local maxima in $\theta_z(t)$ should line up with negative $\alpha_z(t)$
3. inflection points in $\theta_z(t)$ should line up with zero crossings in $\alpha_z(t)$

    Use the slope of $\theta_z(t)$: rising means positive acceleration and falling means negative acceleration.

  correct: true
- id: d
  content: |-
    Use the turning points of $\theta_z(t)$: every maximum and minimum means acceleration is zero.

## Summary

To match an angular-position graph to an angular-acceleration graph, read the concavity of $\theta_z(t)$.

Concave up means the slope of $\theta_z(t)$ is increasing, so $\alpha_z(t)>0$. Concave down means the slope is decreasing, so $\alpha_z(t)<0$. When the concavity changes, the acceleration graph should cross zero.

The main trap is using position height or velocity sign instead of concavity. Acceleration is the second derivative of position, so the matching graph follows how the slope changes.
