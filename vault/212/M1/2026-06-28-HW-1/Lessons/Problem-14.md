## Introduction

When a problem gives a graph of angular position $\theta(t)$ and asks for angular velocity, read the velocity from the slope of the position graph:

$$
\omega_z(t)=\frac{d\theta}{dt}.
$$

The recognition cue is a graph of position over time paired with possible graphs of $\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$. The reusable move is to match the velocity graph to the sign, zeroes, and relative size of the slope of $\theta(t)$.

A good matching order is:

1. Mark every smooth peak and valley of $\theta(t)$. The velocity must be $0$ there.
2. Between those times, decide whether $\theta(t)$ is increasing or decreasing. That sets the sign of velocity.
3. Compare steep and gentle parts of $\theta(t)$. That sets the relative size of velocity.

The main trap is reading the height of $\theta(t)$ instead of its slope. A point above the horizontal axis does not automatically mean positive velocity. Velocity is positive only where the position graph is rising.

## Read Velocity as Slope

**Example:** A position graph slopes downward from $t=0$ to $t=1$, then slopes upward from $t=1$ to $t=2$. What happens to the velocity sign?

**Explanation**

Angular velocity is the slope of angular position.

From $t=0$ to $t=1$, the graph is decreasing, so the slope is negative:

$$
\frac{d\theta}{dt}<0.
$$

From $t=1$ to $t=2$, the graph is increasing, so the slope is positive:

$$
\frac{d\theta}{dt}>0.
$$

So the velocity graph should be below the time axis first, then above the time axis.

## Mark Where Velocity Is Zero

**Example:** A smooth position graph has a local minimum at $t=0.8$ and a local maximum at $t=2.5$. Where should the velocity graph cross or touch the time axis?

**Explanation**

At a smooth local maximum or local minimum, the tangent line is horizontal. A horizontal tangent has slope $0$.

So

$$
\frac{d\theta}{dt}=0
$$

at both turning points:

$$
t=0.8 \quad \text{and} \quad t=2.5.
$$

Those are the times where the velocity graph should be on the horizontal axis.

## Match the Sign Pattern

**Example:** A smooth position graph decreases, then increases, then decreases, then increases. What is the sign pattern for its velocity?

**Explanation**

Translate each interval from position behavior to velocity sign:

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\text{Position graph} & \text{Slope} & \text{Velocity sign} \\
\hline
\text{decreasing} & \text{negative} & \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}<0 \\
\text{increasing} & \text{positive} & \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}>0 \\
\text{decreasing} & \text{negative} & \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}<0 \\
\text{increasing} & \text{positive} & \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}>0
\end{array}
$$

So the velocity graph should go below, above, below, above the time axis.

## Use Steepness to Choose the Best Graph

**Example:** Two answer choices have the right sign pattern. One has a large positive velocity where $\theta(t)$ rises gently, and the other has a large positive velocity where $\theta(t)$ rises steeply. Which one matches better?

**Explanation**

The size of velocity comes from steepness.

A gentle rise means a small positive slope, so $\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$ should be positive but close to $0$.

A steep rise means a large positive slope, so $\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$ should be farther above the time axis.

Use this after checking the sign pattern and the zeroes. Sign and zeroes usually eliminate the biggest mistakes; steepness chooses between graphs that are otherwise close.

## Match the Homework Graph

**Example:** Match the angular velocity graph to this angular position graph.

![](<../Source/Images/angular-position-vs-time.png>)

**Explanation**

Track the slope of the blue position graph, starting with the turning points.

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\text{Part of the position graph} & \theta(t)\text{ behavior} & \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}\text{ sign} \\
\hline
\text{start to first valley} & \text{decreasing} & \text{negative} \\
\text{first valley to first peak} & \text{increasing} & \text{positive} \\
\text{first peak to second valley} & \text{decreasing} & \text{negative} \\
\text{second valley to }5\text{ s} & \text{increasing} & \text{positive}
\end{array}
$$

The velocity must also be $0$ at each smooth valley or peak of $\theta(t)$. Those zeroes should line up with the turning points of the position graph, not with the times when $\theta(t)$ crosses the horizontal axis.

This rules out option B because it stays positive even when the position graph is decreasing. It rules out option C because it is positive early and negative near the end, the opposite of the needed slope signs. It rules out option D because it has extra sign changes that do not come from turning points of the position graph.

Option A starts negative, crosses $0$ at the turning points, becomes negative between the peak and the second valley, and becomes large positive during the steep final rise. So option A matches.

## Summary

To match angular velocity to angular position, read $\dfrac{d\theta}{dt}$ as the slope of $\theta(t)$.

Use this checklist:

- Increasing $\theta(t)$ means positive velocity
- Decreasing $\theta(t)$ means negative velocity
- Local maxima and local minima of $\theta(t)$ give velocity $0$
- Steeper position graphs give larger velocity magnitudes

Do not choose a velocity graph by copying the height of $\theta(t)$. Match the slope behavior instead.
