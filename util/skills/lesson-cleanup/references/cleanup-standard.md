# Assignment Cleanup Standard

## Markdown file boundary

- Begin every Markdown file created or modified by lesson cleanup with exactly one empty line. The first byte is a newline and substantive content begins on line 2.
- Collapse multiple leading empty lines to one.
- Represent an otherwise empty placeholder `.md` file as a single newline.
- Preserve a final newline at end of file.

## Quiz type selection

Invoke `$quiz-block-factory` before creating or changing a quiz block. Its schema reference is the single authority for supported types, canonical fields, answer encoding, feedback placement, and validation. Do not maintain a second field or type table in this cleanup reference.

For cleanup, preserve the source response shape and supplied choices. Choose among the factory-supported types from the task's response shape, not the number of sentences in its stem. Never change a fixed-choice source question into a different assessment merely to avoid an unknown answer key.

## Multipart problems

- Put shared givens, directions, and diagrams once before the part blocks.
- Give each independently answerable part its own block ID: `q-5a`, `q-5b`, and so on.
- Do not create a separate block for a drawing, derivation, explanation, or “show your work” direction that only supports one answer field. Use one block for the answerable response and include the supporting-work checklist in its feedback or reference answer.
- Use mixed types when appropriate. A diagram part can be `free`, followed by calculation parts using `blank`.
- Use one `select` only when all parts draw from the same option bank.
- Use one `multi-select` only when grouped dropdowns materially improve clarity.
- Do not force an entire multipart problem into `free` because one part requires a drawing.

## Correctness and source fidelity

- Preserve supplied option wording and academic meaning.
- Follow `$quiz-block-factory` for canonical correctness fields and cardinality once the answer key is established.
- Do not change a source question into checkbox merely because the correct radio option says “B and D only.”
- Repeated option text is not an image duplicate. Preserve it when it is present in the source, and report ambiguity if it creates more than one equivalent answer.
- Do not infer a missing answer key from option position or prior shuffle order.
- When the key is known, use the factory's feedback standard. Explain each supplied distractor's objective error and the controlling rule; attribute a specific misconception only when the option or source context supports it.
- When the key is genuinely unknown, do not invent correct flags, answer explanations, or a student's reasoning. Preserve the source question, run structural validation, and report both the exception and any consequent correctness-validation failure. In a mixed document, still require and lint feedback for the known-key blocks; treat only failures confined to unknown-key blocks as explicit exceptions.
- For `free`, follow the factory's reference-answer and feedback policy; do not imply that wording must match exactly.
- For `blank`, put the literal response the student should type inside `==...==`, not a typeset representation of that response.
- Keep hidden answers plain and keyboard-enterable. Never wrap them in `$...$` or include LaTeX such as `\frac`, `\times`, `\sqrt`, `\mathrm`, or spacing commands. Do not include an equation label such as `f_5=` or a unit when the prompt requests a number only.
- Prefer `require_exact: true` when an authoritative answer has one canonical typed form. Use `require_exact: false` only for an intentional answer-reveal field or when multiple equivalent typed forms make exact string grading inappropriate.
- Use ordinary typed forms for nonnumeric answers too, such as `increases`, `pi/3`, or `x^2 + 1`. Put polished LaTeX in the prompt or feedback instead.

## Typed blank answers

- Treat the text inside each answer marker as input data, not display content.
- Match the source response format. If it says “Enter your answer in Hz,” store `500`, not `500 Hz`, `$500\ \mathrm{Hz}$`, or `$f_5=5.0\times10^2\ \mathrm{Hz}$`.
- Preserve meaningful decimal zeros when the typed answer requires them, such as `0.40`. When an integer entry such as `500` represents two significant figures, document the precise form $5.0\times10^2$ in feedback rather than encoding it in the input answer.
- For a symbolic or textual response, choose a natural ASCII form that can be typed without LaTeX knowledge. If several forms are equally valid, do not force exact string grading.
- State the expected input convention in the prompt when ambiguity is possible: “Enter a number only,” “Do not include units,” or “Use `pi` for $\pi$.”

## Numerical answers and significant figures

- Always independently check numerical answers, including supplied answers, for arithmetic, units, and significant figures.
- Follow an explicit rounding, decimal-place, tolerance, or significant-figure instruction from the source when one is present.
- Otherwise, round multiplication and division results to the fewest significant figures among the measured givens. For addition and subtraction, round to the least precise decimal place.
- Treat counted quantities, defined conversion factors, mathematical constants, and symbolic coefficients as exact unless the source indicates otherwise.
- Keep guard digits throughout intermediate calculations and round only the final displayed answer. Do not create intermediate-rounding error in feedback.
- Preserve trailing zeros that communicate precision, including forms such as $0.40$ or $2.0\times10^3$. If the source expects a bare integer input such as `2000`, preserve the significant-figure notation in feedback.
- Do not force a decimal approximation when an exact symbolic answer is more appropriate. When useful, show the exact expression first and its correctly rounded numerical value second.
- Keep units attached to displayed numerical results in prose and feedback, and verify that the unit dimensions are consistent. Omit units from the hidden answer when the source asks for a number only.
- If an authoritative supplied answer conflicts with the significant figures implied by the prompt, preserve the source meaning, use the best-supported presentation, and report the ambiguity rather than silently guessing.

## IDs and option order

- Use unique block IDs across the document.
- Use problem-based IDs: `q-1`, `q-8`, `q-8a`.
- Use short option IDs such as `a`, `b`, `c` within `radio` and `checkbox`.
- Use semantic IDs in shared option banks when helpful: `increases`, `decreases`, `unchanged`.
- Use `shuffle: true` only when reordering cannot change meaning.
- Omit shuffle for sequences, “all of the above,” “none of the above,” paired labels tied to order, or choices referenced by another part.

## Question and image order

For a single quiz block, keep the entire assessable stem and image in `content`:

````markdown
## Problem 3

```quiz
type: radio
id: q-3
shuffle: true
content: |-
  **Question 3**

  The graph shows ...

  ![](<Source/Assignment/Images/descriptive-graph.png>)
options:
...
```
````

For multipart work, keep shared material outside:

````markdown
## Problem 4

Shared setup and directions.

![](<Source/Assignment/Images/shared-diagram.png>)

```quiz
type: free
id: q-4a
content: |-
  **Question 4 — Part A**

  Draw ...
correct: |-
  The drawing should include ...
```

```quiz
type: blank
id: q-4b
require_exact: true
content: |-
  **Part B**

  Enter the result in meters per second as a number only: ==42==
feedback: |-
  The correctly rounded result is $42\ \mathrm{m/s}$.
```
````

Do not repeat the same shared image between adjacent part blocks. Across separate problem sections, reuse the same canonical file path when the source diagram is the same; repeat the embed when each question must remain independently readable.

## Daily lecture quiz folders

Treat the source notes as canonical:

```text
2026-06-24-M1-1/
├── 2026-06-24-M1-1.md
└── Source/
    ├── M1-1-PRE.md
    ├── M1-1-LEC.md
    └── Images/
```

For a single-step PRE or LEC question, do not add `## Problem N`. Put the source question label inside the block:

````markdown
```quiz
type: radio
id: m1-1pre-q1
content: |-
  **Question 1**

  Question text...
options:
...
```
````

For a multipart source question, use one `## Question N` heading for shared context and put only the part labels inside the associated blocks.

Make the dated root note a composition rather than a copy:

```markdown
## Pre-Lecture Quiz

![[Source/M1-1-PRE]]

## Lecture Quiz

![[Source/M1-1-LEC]]
```

Omit a section whose source is missing or empty. Preserve source-specific quiz IDs so PRE and LEC IDs remain unique when embedded together.

## Image ownership and naming

Canonical assignment path:

```text
Assignment/
├── Assignment.md
└── Source/
    └── Assignment/
        └── Images/
            └── descriptive-name.png
```

Assignment-owned images include:

- Images referenced by the assignment root Markdown.
- Loose screenshots or uploads dropped into the assignment root.
- Files already inside `Source/<assignment-name>/Images`.

For daily lecture folders, use the shared `Source/Images` directory. PRE and LEC source notes reference those images as `Images/<descriptive-name>`. The dated root note receives the images through source-note embeds and must not contain rewritten duplicate image links.

Protected images include:

- `Lessons/...`
- `Prerequisites/...`
- `Source/<Math-Academy-topic>/...`
- Any other copied source package not owned by the assignment

Naming rules:

- Use lowercase kebab-case.
- Name the physical setup or information shown: `rod-ball-inelastic-collision.png`.
- Include `graph`, `diagram`, `geometry`, `free-body-diagram`, or another useful qualifier.
- Avoid generic names such as `image.png`, `screenshot-2.png`, or opaque upload hashes.
- Avoid problem numbers when the same image serves several questions.
- Preserve the original extension unless conversion has a clear benefit.

## Duplicate policy

Classify candidates in this order:

1. Exact byte duplicates: safe to consolidate after reference checks.
2. Exact decoded-pixel duplicates: safe to consolidate after reference checks even if metadata or encoding differs.
3. Visually similar candidates: inspect manually; do not delete automatically.
4. Same subject but different crop, resolution, annotation, labels, or state: retain when the difference carries information.

Always update all Markdown references before removing the redundant file. Re-run the audit afterward.
